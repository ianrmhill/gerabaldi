class TestSpec:
    """
    Definition of a test specification that can be executed/simulated using the Gerabaldi simulator.

    This class defines a wear-out test specification that can be executed experimentally. The process of executing a
    test involves conducting a series of stress and measurement tasks sequentially, thus this class is implemented to be
    iterable over the test steps. Every call to 'next' will return the next test action, either a stress interval to
    simulate or a set of measurements to take. Notably, however, this class does NOT track simulated degradation, it
    only specifies the test. The simulator itself persists the degradation and measurements between steps.
